Welcome to **The Pawn Gambit**, a minimalist, chess-inspired survival roguelike. In this challenging game, you control a single black piece and must survive as long as possible against an ever-growing army of white pieces. Every move counts as you collect experience, gather gems, and upgrade your piece to become more powerful.
